Hi, I need a shell script named `ViteCreator.sh` that does the following:

1. Prompts the user for the directory path where the React Vite project will be created.
2. Expands tilde (~) to the home directory if present in the path.
3. Creates the directory if it doesn't exist.
4. Navigates to the directory and confirms navigation.
5. Prompts the user for the project name.
6. Uses `npx create-vite@latest` to create a React Vite project in the specified directory.
7. Installs project dependencies using `npm install`.
8. Automatically opens a new shell in the project directory.

The script should handle errors gracefully and notify the user at each step. Could you provide that script?
